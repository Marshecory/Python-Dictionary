# 30-Word-Python-Dictionary
This Python script implements a basic dictionary-based lookup system.  The program initializes a dictionary with 30 key-value pairs, where the keys represent words and the values represent their corresponding definitions.  User input is then used to query the dictionary for specific definitions.
